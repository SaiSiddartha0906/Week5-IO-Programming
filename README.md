# Week 5: Java I/O and File Handling

Welcome to the repository for Week 5 of our Java learning journey. This week focused on input/output (I/O) operations, file handling, and understanding how Java interacts with external data through streams, readers, and writers.

## üß≠ Overview
This week was all about learning how Java manages input and output streams. We explored working with files (reading, writing, and checking metadata), used both byte and character streams, and even performed object serialization. These topics are essential for building applications that interact with external systems, logs, or persistent storage.

## üìå Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Java I/O
- What is I/O in Java?
- InputStream and OutputStream hierarchy
- Reader and Writer hierarchy
- Checked exceptions in I/O

### Day 2: File Handling with `File` Class
- Creating, deleting, and checking file existence
- Reading file properties (name, path, size)
- Creating directories
- Listing directory contents

### Day 3: Byte Streams (`FileInputStream` & `FileOutputStream`)
- Reading bytes from a file
- Writing bytes to a file
- Handling binary data
- Closing streams safely

### Day 4: Character Streams (`FileReader` & `FileWriter`)
- Reading characters from a file
- Writing text files
- Unicode and character encoding
- Comparing byte vs character streams

### Day 5: Buffered Streams and Serialization
- Using `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for efficient I/O
- Object serialization with `ObjectOutputStream`
- Deserialization with `ObjectInputStream`
- `transient` keyword and serialVersionUID

### Day 6: Practice Problems and Exception Handling in I/O
- Reading data from a file and performing calculations
- Writing logs to a file
- Catching and handling I/O exceptions
- Try-with-resources for automatic resource management

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Java 8+ installed on your system
- Familiarity with Java Collections and Streams (Week 3 & 4)
- Basic understanding of exception handling

## üìÇ How to Use This Repository
This repository is organized into daily folders. Each folder contains code examples and exercises focused on that day's topic. You can clone or download the repository, open it in your IDE, and run the programs to get hands-on experience with Java I/O.
